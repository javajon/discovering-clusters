# Discovering Clusters With Minikube #

Example containers one can run on a Kubernetes cluster, such as Minikube.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
* Clone this project with Git
* Run the R/deploy.sh script that uses KubeCtl to stand up the 
cluster containing R Shiny engine and its dashboard. On Windows use the Git Bash command prompt to run Bash scripts.
* Run the Shop/deploy.sh script that uses KubeCtl to stand up the 
Shopping application with an example UI back with Microservices
